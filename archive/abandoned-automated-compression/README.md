## Why It Failed

### The Approach

We built a multi-agent system to automatically compress 10k-20k token conversations into 800-1400 token AICF summaries:

1. **Analysis Agent** - Compressed conversations into AICF format
2. **Quality Agent** - Validated key term preservation (60%+ required)
3. **Format Agent** - Ensured AICF 3.0 compliance

### Test Results

**12k token files (18 key terms):**
- ✅ 90-100% key term preservation
- ✅ 100% success rate
- ✅ Good quality

**20k token files (123 key terms):**
- ❌ 20-26% key term preservation (average 23%)
- ❌ 0% success rate (0/5 tests passed)
- ❌ Lost 90 of 123 key terms

### The Fundamental Problem

**The compression AI cannot determine what's important.**

When compressing 20k tokens with 123 key terms (prices, percentages, model names, file paths, versions), the AI:
- Doesn't know which numbers matter vs. mentioned in passing
- Lacks context about what the original conversation participants consider critical
- Prioritizes high-level insights over granular details
- Achieves good compression ratio (88-92%) but loses critical information

### Cost Analysis

- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 (best performer at 87.5% success on 12k tokens)
- **Cost:** $14.63/month at 20k token checkpoints
- **Processing Time:** 2 minutes per checkpoint
- **Quality:** 23% key term preservation on 20k tokens (need 60%+)

## What We Learned

### Key Insights

1. **Automated compression fundamentally flawed** - AI cannot determine importance without context
2. **Prompt engineering insufficient** - Changing from "compress" to "detailed summary" only improved preservation from 27% to 32%
3. **Token limits counterproductive** - Removing token range checks didn't solve the core problem
4. **Model selection irrelevant** - Even best model (Claude Sonnet 4) failed on 20k tokens

### Models Tested

1. **Claude Haiku 3.5** - 0% success (empty output)
2. **GPT-4o Mini** - 0% success (empty output)
3. **GPT-5 Mini** - 0% success (may not exist yet)
4. **GPT-4.1** - 25% success (missing @STATE section)
5. **GPT-4o** - 100% success on 12k tokens (85% preservation)
6. **Claude Sonnet 4** - 87.5% success on 12k tokens (92.6% preservation), 0% on 20k

## The Solution: Manual AICF Writing

### What We Adopted Instead

**AI writes `.aicf/` files at end of session (manual approach):**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 100% preservation (AI controls what to save)
- ✅ Zero cost (no API calls)
- ✅ Instant (no processing time)
- ✅ Full control (human reviews before commit)
- ✅ AI knows what it needs to remember

**Workflow:**
1. User says "chat-finish" or similar
2. AI updates `.aicf/` files with conversation memory
3. User reviews changes
4. User commits to version control
5. Next session: AI reads files and has perfect memory

## Technical Details

### Multi-Agent Architecture

```javascript
class Orchestrator {
  constructor() {
    this.analysisAgent = new AnalysisAgent();
    this.qualityAgent = new QualityAgent();
    this.formatAgent = new FormatAgent();
  }

  async processCheckpoint(checkpoint) {
    // Step 1: Compress
    let compressed = await this.analysisAgent.analyze(checkpoint);
    
    // Step 2: Validate quality
    let quality = await this.qualityAgent.verify(checkpoint, compressed);
    
    // Step 3: Retry if failed
    if (!quality.approved) {
      compressed = await this.analysisAgent.analyze(checkpoint);
      quality = await this.qualityAgent.verify(checkpoint, compressed);
    }
    
    // Step 4: Validate format
    const format = await this.formatAgent.validateFormat(compressed);
    
    return { compressed, quality, format };
  }
}
```

### Quality Validation

```javascript
class QualityAgent {
  extractKeyTerms(checkpoint) {
    // Extract: prices, percentages, model names, file paths, versions
    const patterns = [
      /\$\d+\.?\d*/g,           // Prices
      /\d+%/g,                  // Percentages
      /\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:[A-Z][a-z]+)+\b/g, // CamelCase
      /\b[a-z]+[-_][a-z]+\b/gi, // kebab-case, snake_case
    ];
    // ...
  }

  async verify(original, compressed) {
    const keyTerms = this.extractKeyTerms(original);
    const preserved = keyTerms.filter(term =>
      compressed.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())
    );
    
    const preservationRatio = preserved.length / keyTerms.length;
    const approved = preservationRatio >= 0.6; // Need 60%+
    
    return { approved, preservationRatio, keyTerms, preserved };
  }
}
```

## Lessons for Future

### What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Don't try to automate AI memory compression
2. ❌ Don't rely on regex-based quality validation for semantic content
3. ❌ Don't assume prompt engineering can solve fundamental limitations
4. ❌ Don't use one AI to compress another AI's conversation

### What DOES Work

1. ✅ Let the conversation AI write its own memory
2. ✅ Use structured format (AICF) for efficiency
3. ✅ Manual approach with human review
4. ✅ Trust AI to know what it needs to remember
5. ✅ Zero-cost, instant, 100% preservation
