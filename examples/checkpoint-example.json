The MemoryDropOffAgent will handle this intelligently:\n\n- **Recent conversations** (< 7 days): Keep full detail\n- **Medium age** (7-30 days): Extract key insights and decisions\n- **Old conversations** (> 30 days): Compress to essential context only\n- **Ancient history** (> 90 days): Archive with minimal metadata\n\nIt monitors file sizes and applies decay automatically when the .aicf files exceed 1MB.
