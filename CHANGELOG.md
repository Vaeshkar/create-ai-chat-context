### üöÄ NEW FEATURE: Token Management Tools

This release adds powerful token management features to help you keep your knowledge base efficient.

### Added

- **`tokens` command** - Show detailed token usage breakdown

  - Displays token count per file
  - Shows percentage of context window used
  - Compares against GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude context windows
  - Provides recommendations based on usage
  - Example: `npx create-ai-chat-context tokens`

- **`archive` command** - Archive old conversation logs

  - Moves old entries to `.ai/archive/` directory
  - Keeps specified number of recent entries in main log
  - Preserves all history in dated archive files
  - Example: `npx create-ai-chat-context archive --keep 10`

- **`summary` command** - Summarize old conversation logs

  - Condenses old entries into brief summaries
  - Keeps specified number of recent entries detailed
  - Reduces token usage by 60-80%
  - Example: `npx create-ai-chat-context summary --keep 10`

- **TOKEN_MANAGEMENT.md template** - Comprehensive guide
  - Explains token usage and why it matters
  - Shows typical token usage at different project stages
  - Provides management strategies and best practices
  - Includes examples and quick reference

### Enhanced

- **README.md** - Added "Token Usage & Management" section

  - Token usage table by project stage
  - Efficiency comparison (with vs without the system)
  - Token management commands documentation
  - Best practices for keeping token usage low

- **Usage documentation** - Added new commands to usage section
  - `tokens` command examples
  - `archive` command with options
  - `summary` command with options

### Why This Update?

**Problem:** Users asked: "How many tokens does this use? Will it fill up the context window?"

**Answer:**

- Fresh project: ~3,000 tokens (1.5% of Claude)
- Active project (10 chats): ~8,000 tokens (4%)
- Mature project (50 chats): ~22,000 tokens (11%)
- Large project (100+ chats): ~40,000-50,000 tokens (20-25%)

**Solution:** New tools to monitor and manage token usage:

- Check usage anytime with `tokens` command
- Archive old conversations when needed
- Summarize history to reduce tokens
- Clear guidance on when to take action

### Token Efficiency

**Without this system:**

- 1,800-3,500 tokens wasted per chat on re-explanation
- Over 50 chats: 90,000-175,000 tokens wasted

**With this system:**

- 22,000 tokens for persistent context (50 chats)
- **Net savings: 68,000-153,000 tokens + 8-15 hours of time**

### Commands Summary

```bash
# Check token usage
npx create-ai-chat-context tokens

# Archive old conversations (keep 10 recent)
npx create-ai-chat-context archive --keep 10

# Summarize old conversations (keep 10 detailed)
npx create-ai-chat-context summary --keep 10
```

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Users can monitor token usage
- ‚úÖ Users can manage large conversation logs
- ‚úÖ Clear guidance on when to take action
- ‚úÖ Tools to reduce token usage by 60-80%
- ‚úÖ Preserves all history (archive) or context (summary)

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Check tokens every 10-20 chats
2. Archive or summarize after 30+ chats
3. Keep token usage under 25,000 for optimal performance

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-01

### üéØ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Chat Continuity & Better Instructions

This release significantly improves how AI assistants maintain context across chat sessions.

### Enhanced

- **`.ai-instructions` template** - Completely rewritten to be generic and universal

  - Removed project-specific content (was referencing "toy-store-unified")
  - Added MANDATORY workflow section (START ‚Üí DURING ‚Üí END)
  - Added CRITICAL reminders to update files before ending session
  - Provided exact template for updating conversation-log.md
  - Multiple warnings emphasizing importance of updates

- **`conversation-log.md` template** - Much clearer instructions for AI assistants

  - Added explicit instructions at the top for when to read/update
  - Provided detailed template with concrete examples
  - Added tips for writing good entries
  - Added reminder section with step-by-step update process

- **`NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md`** - New recommended prompts for chat continuity

  - Added: "Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #[number]"
  - Added: "Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #[number], then help me [task]"
  - Marked continuity prompts as RECOMMENDED and BEST
  - Added complete workflow example showing Chat #1 ‚Üí #2 ‚Üí #3

- **`README.md`** - Better documentation of chat continuity feature
  - Added continuity prompts to Quick Start section
  - Updated Usage Examples with first chat vs. continuing chat
  - Added new section: "üîÑ Chat Continuity Example"
  - Shows concrete example of how Chat #1 ‚Üí #2 ‚Üí #3 flow works

### Why This Update?

**Problem:** The original `.ai-instructions` template was copied from a specific project and contained:

- References to "toy-store-unified" project
- Specific tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)
- Mentions of "19+ chat sessions" and specific decisions
- This confused AI assistants when used in new projects

**Solution:**

- Made all templates truly generic and universal
- Added explicit workflow instructions for AI assistants
- Emphasized the importance of updating conversation-log.md
- Provided recommended prompts that make continuity explicit

**Result:**

- AI assistants now understand they MUST update files at end of session
- Users can explicitly tell AI to continue from previous chat
- Much better context preservation across sessions
- Clear examples of how Chat #1 ‚Üí #2 ‚Üí #3 should work

### Recommended Prompts

**First chat:**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, then help me with [your task].
```

**Continuing from previous chat (RECOMMENDED):**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, and help me continue where we left off with chat #[number].
```

**Best option (most explicit):**

```
Read .ai-instructions first, continue from chat #[number], then help me [specific task].
```

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Better chat continuity across sessions
- ‚úÖ AI assistants know exactly what to do
- ‚úÖ Explicit reminders to update knowledge base
- ‚úÖ Clear workflow: START ‚Üí DURING ‚Üí END
- ‚úÖ Users can reference specific previous chats
- ‚úÖ No more confusion from project-specific templates

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you installed v0.1.0, v0.1.1, or v0.1.2, consider re-running `init --force` to get the improved templates!**

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-01

### üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX

- **REMOVED PRIVATE DATA FROM TEMPLATES** - Templates contained actual project data from toy-store-ai-system
- **REPLACED WITH GENERIC TEMPLATES** - All templates now use placeholder text
- **NO MORE DATA LEAKAGE** - Safe to use on any project

### Fixed

- `architecture.md` - Now generic template with placeholders
- `conversation-log.md` - Now generic template with examples
- `technical-decisions.md` - Now generic template with structure
- `known-issues.md` - Now generic template with format
- `next-steps.md` - Now generic template with sections

### Why This Update?

- **User reported:** Templates contained private project information
- **Impact:** HIGH - Could leak sensitive data to other projects
- **Fix:** Replaced all templates with generic placeholders
- **Status:** SAFE - No more private data in templates

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you installed v0.1.0 or v0.1.1, please update immediately!**
