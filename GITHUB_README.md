## 🤔 The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Augment, etc.), you face a frustrating issue:

**Every new chat session loses all context.**

You have to re-explain:
- Your project architecture
- Technical decisions you made
- Why you chose X over Y
- What you accomplished in previous sessions
- Known issues and solutions

**This wastes 30+ minutes EVERY chat session.** 😤

---

## ✅ The Solution

`create-ai-chat-context` creates a `.ai/` knowledge base in your project that AI assistants read at the start of each chat.

**Result:** AI gets full context in 2 seconds. No more re-explaining!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Initialize AI knowledge base
npx create-ai-chat-context init

# Customize the files for your project
vim .ai/architecture.md
vim .ai/technical-decisions.md

# Commit to Git
git add .ai/ .ai-instructions NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md
git commit -m "feat: Add .ai/ knowledge base system"

# In your next AI chat, use this prompt:
"Read .ai-instructions first, then help me with [your task]."
```

**That's it!** AI now has full context. 🎉
