## How to Use

1. **For AI Assistants**: Read all files in this directory for full project context
2. **For Developers**: Update these files as your project evolves

## Files

- **project-overview.md** - Technology stack and architecture
- **conversation-log.md** - Chat history and decisions  
- **technical-decisions.md** - Why we chose specific technologies
- **next-steps.md** - Current priorities and tasks
- **design-system.md** - UI/UX patterns and components
