## What This Does

1. AI reads `.ai-instructions` (root-level file)
2. `.ai-instructions` points to `.ai/` knowledge base
3. AI gets full context immediately
4. No need to explain architecture, decisions, or history

---

## Why This Works

- Explicit instruction - AI knows exactly what to do
- Single command - One line, easy to copy/paste
- Triggers chain - `.ai-instructions` â†’ `.ai/` directory
- Saves time - No need to re-explain context
