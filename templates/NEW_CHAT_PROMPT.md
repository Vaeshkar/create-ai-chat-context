## What This Does:

1. âœ… AI reads `.ai-instructions` (root-level file)
2. âœ… `.ai-instructions` points to `.ai/` knowledge base
3. âœ… `.ai-instructions` points to `claude/ai-instructions/`
4. âœ… AI gets full context immediately
5. âœ… No need to explain architecture, decisions, or history

## Test Results:

### Chat #20 (FAILED):

- AI didn't discover knowledge base automatically
- Had to be told twice

### Chat #21 (PARTIAL SUCCESS):

- "index please" â†’ Indexed codebase only
- Test questions â†’ Triggered reading `.ai/` files
- Needed two prompts

### Chat #22 (COMPLETE SUCCESS): âœ…

- **Prompt:** "Read .ai-instructions first"
- âœ… AI read ALL files immediately (`.ai/` + `claude/ai-instructions/`)
- âœ… AI confirmed full context
- âœ… AI answered all 7 test questions perfectly
- âœ… Ready to work with ZERO explanation needed
- âœ… Saves 30+ minutes every chat

### Lesson Learned:

**The one-liner works perfectly! Use "Read .ai-instructions first" at the start of every new chat.**
