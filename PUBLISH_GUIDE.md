I just published create-ai-chat-context v0.1.1 - an open-source tool that solves a major pain point in AI-assisted development.

The Problem:
Every new AI chat session loses all context. You waste 30+ minutes re-explaining your architecture, decisions, and history.

A simple CLI tool that creates a .ai/ knowledge base in your project. AI assistants read it at the start of each chat and have full context in 2 seconds.

Key Features:
✅ Works with ALL AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Augment, Codeium, Tabnine, etc.)
✅ Plain markdown files - no proprietary format
✅ Proven to save 30+ minutes per chat session
✅ Open source (MIT License)
