# Testing chat-finish-v2.js

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## What's New in v2?

### ‚úÖ Updates BOTH .ai/ and .aicf/ Files

**Old version (chat-finish.js):**
- ‚ùå Only updated `.ai/conversation-log.md`
- ‚ùå Only updated `.ai/architecture.md` timestamp
- ‚ùå Didn't touch `.aicf/` files at all
- ‚ùå Too minimal, not enough information captured

**New version (chat-finish-v2.js):**
- ‚úÖ Updates `.ai/conversation-log.md` with full entry
- ‚úÖ Updates `.ai/technical-decisions.md` (if decisions)
- ‚úÖ Updates `.ai/known-issues.md` (if issues)
- ‚úÖ Updates `.ai/next-steps.md` (if next steps)
- ‚úÖ Updates `.aicf/conversation-memory.aicf` with AICF format
- ‚úÖ Updates `.aicf/technical-context.aicf` (if decisions)
- ‚úÖ Updates `.aicf/work-state.aicf` with current status

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Analyze Changes
- Detects git changes (modified, new, deleted files)
- Shows file statistics (+additions, -deletions)
- Lists recent commits

### Phase 2: Gather Information
Asks user for:
- **Main goal** (with smart default from git commits)
- **Key decisions** (optional, comma-separated)
- **Key insights** (optional, comma-separated)
- **Issues found** (optional, comma-separated)
- **Next steps** (optional, comma-separated)

### Phase 3: Update .ai/ Files
- `conversation-log.md` - Adds new chat entry with all info
- `technical-decisions.md` - Adds decisions (if any)
- `known-issues.md` - Adds issues (if any)
- `next-steps.md` - Adds next steps (if any)

### Phase 4: Update .aicf/ Files
- `conversation-memory.aicf` - Updates @FLOW, @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE
- `technical-context.aicf` - Adds decisions to context
- `work-state.aicf` - Updates @CURRENT and @NEXT

### Phase 5: Show Summary
- Shows what was updated
- Reminds user to review and commit

## What to Test

### ‚úÖ Basic Functionality
- [ ] Command runs without errors
- [ ] Prompts are clear and user-friendly
- [ ] Git changes are detected correctly
- [ ] Default goal is smart (from git commits)

### ‚úÖ .ai/ File Updates
- [ ] conversation-log.md gets new entry
- [ ] Chat number increments correctly
- [ ] Decisions are added to technical-decisions.md
- [ ] Issues are added to known-issues.md
- [ ] Next steps are added to next-steps.md

### ‚úÖ .aicf/ File Updates
- [ ] conversation-memory.aicf gets updated
- [ ] @FLOW section has new entry
- [ ] @INSIGHTS section has insights (if provided)
- [ ] @DECISIONS section has decisions (if provided)
- [ ] @STATE section is updated
- [ ] technical-context.aicf gets decisions (if provided)
- [ ] work-state.aicf is updated

### ‚úÖ Edge Cases
- [ ] Works without git repository
- [ ] Works with no file changes
- [ ] Works with empty inputs (all Enter)
- [ ] Works with long inputs
- [ ] Handles special characters in inputs

---

## Known Limitations

1. **AICF format assumptions** - Assumes sections exist (@FLOW, @INSIGHTS, etc.)
2. **Simple regex** - Section parsing could be more robust
3. **No validation** - Doesn't validate AICF format after update
4. **No backup** - Doesn't create backup before modifying files

---

## If It Works

1. **Archive old version:**
   ```bash
   mv src/chat-finish.js archive/chat-finish-old.js
   ```

2. **Rename new version:**
   ```bash
   mv src/chat-finish-v2.js src/chat-finish.js
   ```

3. **Update CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Change back to: require("../src/chat-finish")
   ```

4. **Test again:**
   ```bash
   aic chat-finish
   ```

---

## If It Doesn't Work

**Report:**
- What error occurred?
- What was the input?
- What files were affected?
- What was expected vs actual?

**Then we'll fix it!** üîß
