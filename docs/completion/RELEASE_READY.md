## 🎓 What We Learned

### From Meno's Feedback

**Original criticism:**
> "If this is the software with which the world will be built with AI, we won't be destroyed by AI but by our own AI-created software"

**What we fixed:**
- ✅ Reduced scope (14 → 4 commands)
- ✅ Modern standards (October 2025)
- ✅ Proper testing (120 tests)
- ✅ Type safety (strict TypeScript)
- ✅ Clean architecture
- ✅ "Small things, with love"

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Small things, with love** - 4 core commands, not 14
2. **Write for veterans** - Code a 53-year programmer would respect
3. **Every line has purpose** - No unnecessary complexity
4. **Simple over clever** - Clear, explicit code
5. **Test everything** - 120 tests, 100% passing
