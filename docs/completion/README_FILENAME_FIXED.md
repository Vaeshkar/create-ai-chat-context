# ✅ README Filename Fixed!

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issue:** README said `code-standards.md` but code creates `code-style.md`  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## 🐛 The Bug

**README.md said:**
```markdown
| **code-standards.md**      | Coding standards and guidelines   |
```

**But init.ts creates:**
```typescript
const AI_TEMPLATE_FILES = [
  'code-style.md',  // ← This is what actually gets created
  // ...
];
```

**And template exists as:**
```
templates/ai/code-style.md  ← This is the actual file
```

**Result:** Mismatch between documentation and reality! 🚨

---

## ✅ The Fix

**Changed README.md and GITHUB_README.md:**
```markdown
| **code-style.md**          | Coding standards and guidelines   |
```

**Now everything matches:**
- ✅ `init.ts` creates `code-style.md`
- ✅ Template is `templates/ai/code-style.md`
- ✅ README says `code-style.md`
- ✅ Users get `code-style.md`

---

## 🎯 Why This Happened

**History:**

1. **v1.0.7** - Had `code-style.md` (CommonJS, old patterns)
2. **v2.0.0 development** - Created `code-standards.md` (TypeScript, modern)
3. **README update** - Accidentally referenced `code-standards.md`
4. **Reality** - Code still creates `code-style.md`

**The confusion:**
- Our project has **both** files:
  - `.ai/code-style.md` (now has modern content)
  - `.ai/code-standards.md` (original modern content)
- But users only get `code-style.md`

## 📊 Current State

### What Users Get (from `aic init`)

```
.ai/
├── README.md
├── conversation-log.md
├── technical-decisions.md
├── next-steps.md
├── code-style.md          ← This file
├── design-system.md
└── project-overview.md
```

### What Our Project Has

```
.ai/
├── README.md
├── conversation-log.md
├── technical-decisions.md
├── next-steps.md
├── code-style.md          ← Modern content (copied from code-standards.md)
├── code-standards.md      ← Original modern content
├── design-system.md
└── project-overview.md
```

**Note:** We have both files, but they now have the same content (modern standards).

---

## 🎯 Decision: Keep `code-style.md` Filename

**Why not rename to `code-standards.md`?**

1. **Backward compatibility** - Existing users have `code-style.md`
2. **Template consistency** - All 32 templates use `code-style.md`
3. **Less work** - No need to update templates or code
4. **Standard naming** - "code-style" is more common than "code-standards"

**What we did instead:**
- ✅ Kept filename as `code-style.md`
- ✅ Updated content to modern standards
- ✅ Fixed README to match reality
- ✅ Updated `.ai-instructions` to reference `code-style.md`

## 📝 Files Changed

### README.md
```diff
- | **code-standards.md**      | Coding standards and guidelines   |
+ | **code-style.md**          | Coding standards and guidelines   |
```

### GITHUB_README.md
```diff
- | **code-standards.md**      | Coding standards and guidelines   |
+ | **code-style.md**          | Coding standards and guidelines   |
```

### .ai-instructions (user already fixed)
```diff
- ### 4. **`.ai/code-standards.md`** (5 minutes) 🚨 CRITICAL FOR CODING
+ ### 4. **`.ai/code-style.md`** (5 minutes) 🚨 CRITICAL FOR CODING
```

## ✅ Verification

### Check What Gets Created

```bash
# Test init command
cd /tmp/test-project
npx aic@latest init

# Check files
ls -la .ai/
# Should show: code-style.md (not code-standards.md)
```

### Check README Accuracy

```bash
# Check README
grep "code-" README.md
# Should show: code-style.md

# Check what init.ts creates
grep "code-" src/commands/init.ts
# Should show: 'code-style.md',

# Check template
ls templates/ai/ | grep code
# Should show: code-style.md
```

**All should match!** ✅

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation Must Match Reality

**Problem:** README said one thing, code did another

**Solution:** Always verify documentation against actual behavior

### 2. Naming Consistency Matters

**Problem:** We had two files with similar names (`code-style.md` vs `code-standards.md`)

**Solution:** Pick one name and stick with it

### 3. Backward Compatibility is Important

**Problem:** Changing filename would break existing users

**Solution:** Keep filename, update content

---

## 🚀 Impact

### Before Fix

**User experience:**
1. Read README: "You'll get `code-standards.md`"
2. Run `aic init`
3. Get `code-style.md` instead
4. Confusion! 😕

### After Fix

**User experience:**
1. Read README: "You'll get `code-style.md`"
2. Run `aic init`
3. Get `code-style.md` as expected
4. Happy! 😊

## 📊 Summary

**Issue:** README referenced wrong filename  
**Root cause:** Confusion between `code-style.md` and `code-standards.md`  
**Fix:** Updated README to match reality  
**Result:** Documentation now accurate  

**Files fixed:**
