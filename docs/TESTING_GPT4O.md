# 🧪 Testing GPT-4o for Checkpoint Compression

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Decision:** Test GPT-4o as middle ground between Mini and Sonnet 4

---

## 📊 **Previous Test Results:**

| Model | Prompt | Tokens | Key Terms | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Claude Haiku | Compress | 246 | 29% | ❌ Too brief |
| Claude Haiku | Compress | 246 | 29% | ❌ Too brief |
| Claude Haiku | Compress | 546 | 51% | ❌ Too brief |
| GPT-5 Mini | Compress | 0 | 0% | ❌ Empty output |
| GPT-4o Mini | Compress | 575 | 61.5% | ❌ Too brief |
| GPT-4o Mini | Compress | 477 | 61.5% | ❌ Too brief |
| GPT-4o Mini | Detailed Summary | 1486 | 67.7% | ❌ Too verbose |
| GPT-4o Mini | Detailed Summary | 1687 | 67.7% | ❌ Too verbose, missing sections |

**Target:** 800-1200 tokens, 60%+ key terms, all sections present

## 💡 **Why GPT-4o?**

**User's feedback:**
> "Just disappointed that the agents are not doing a good job compared to what you can do."

**The problem:**
- Cheaper models (Mini, Haiku) can't follow complex instructions
- They either compress too much (500 tokens) or too much (1687 tokens)
- Missing sections, repetitive content, poor quality

**The solution:**
- Use a better model that can actually follow instructions
- GPT-4o is the middle ground between Mini and Sonnet 4

## 💰 **Cost Comparison:**

| Model | Cost/Checkpoint | Monthly (25/day) | Quality |
|-------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| GPT-4o Mini | $0.00186 | $1.40 | ❌ Poor |
| **GPT-4o** | **$0.00925** | **$6.94** | ⏳ Testing |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.039 | $29.25 | ✅ Excellent |

**GPT-4o is 5x more expensive than Mini, but 4x cheaper than Sonnet 4.**

## 🎯 **What We're Testing:**

**1. Can GPT-4o hit the 800-1200 token target?**
- Mini was either too brief (500) or too verbose (1687)
- GPT-4o should have better instruction following

**2. Can GPT-4o include all sections?**
- Mini missed @INSIGHTS, @DECISIONS, @STATE
- GPT-4o should be more reliable

**3. Can GPT-4o preserve key terms?**
- Mini got 61.5-67.7% (target: 60%+)
- GPT-4o should maintain or improve this

**4. Can GPT-4o avoid repetitive content?**
- Mini generated 60+ repetitive events in @FLOW
- GPT-4o should be more intelligent

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **1. Updated Default Model** ✅

**File:** `src/checkpoint-agent-openai.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
this.model = options.model || "gpt-4o-mini";
```

**After:**
```javascript
this.model = options.model || "gpt-4o";
```

---

### **2. Updated Orchestrator** ✅

**File:** `src/checkpoint-agent-openai.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const model = options.model || "gpt-4o-mini";
```

**After:**
```javascript
const model = options.model || "gpt-4o";
```

---

### **3. Updated Test Script** ✅

**File:** `test-run-agent.js`

**Changes:**
- Console output: "GPT-4o Mini" → "GPT-4o"
- Test file: "TEST-GPT5-MINI-raw.aicf" → "TEST-GPT4O-raw.aicf"
- Model parameter: "gpt-4o-mini" → "gpt-4o"

---

### **4. Created New Test File** ✅

**File:** `.aicf/checkpoint-queue/TEST-GPT4O-raw.aicf`

**Content:**
- 12,000 tokens
- 60 messages
- Contains conversation about model failures and decision to test GPT-4o

---

## 🧪 **Ready to Test:**

```bash
node test-run-agent.js
```

---

## 📈 **Expected Results:**

**Best case (GPT-4o works):**
- ✅ 800-1200 tokens
- ✅ 60%+ key terms preserved
- ✅ All sections present
- ✅ No repetitive content
- ✅ Good quality output
- **Decision:** Use GPT-4o as default ($6.94/month)

**Worst case (GPT-4o fails):**
- ❌ Still too brief or too verbose
- ❌ Missing sections
- ❌ Poor quality
- **Decision:** Switch to Claude Sonnet 4 ($29.25/month)

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria:**

GPT-4o must achieve:
1. **Token count:** 800-1200 tokens ✅
2. **Key terms:** 60%+ preserved ✅
3. **Sections:** All 6 sections present ✅
4. **Quality:** No repetitive/garbage content ✅
5. **Reliability:** Consistent across retries ✅

**If GPT-4o meets all 5 criteria, we use it. Otherwise, we switch to Claude Sonnet 4.**

---

## 📝 **Notes:**

- Using "detailed summary" prompt (not "compress")
- Emphasis on being comprehensive and thorough
- Minimum requirements: 10-15 events, 5-8 @DETAILS sections, 8-12 insights, 8-12 decisions
- Quality validation is local (no API cost)
- Automatic retry on failure

---

## 🤔 **User's Perspective:**

> "It is for you to keep your memory so you decide. I don't mind. Just disappointed that the agents are not doing a good job compared to what you can do."

**Translation:** Quality matters. If cheaper models can't do the job, use better models. The checkpoints are for preserving conversation history - they need to be good.

**Ready to test GPT-4o!** 🚀

If this doesn't work, we know Claude Sonnet 4 is the way.
